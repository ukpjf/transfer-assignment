# How to use `git`

1. Initialize a repository with `git init`
2. Stage your files with `git add .` #add all files 
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit -m 'description' `
4. See your history with `git log`
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout`
6. Create new branches with `git branch 'new_branch'`
7. To collaborate, first `pull` others changes, then `push` yours
